# Rebooting the Web of Trust VIII: Barcelona (March 2019)

This repository contains documents related to RWOT8, the eighth
Rebooting the Web of Trust design workshop, which will run in
Barcelona, Spain on March 1st to 3rd, 2019. The goal of the workshop
was to generate five technical white papers and/or proposals on topics
decided by the group that would have the greatest impact on the
future.

##  Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants produced a one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on either:

* A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
* A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

**NOTE:** To add a paper, create a pull request to this repo with your contribution (preferably .md file or PDF), along with updates to the README.md here and in the Topics and Advanced Readings folder with a link to your paper and your name. Please also include a byline with contact information in the paper itself.

Here are the advanced readings to date:

    * by Yancy Ribbens
    * Micro-payments and DID (Decentralized Identities) can enable a user to curate their online identity, request payment or mark
data private. This article proposes allowing a fee market to develop around what information a user chooses to reveal about their identity in the context of verifiable credentials.

### General Self-Sovereign Identity
* [A Self-Sovereign Identity Framework/Thought Model proposal](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot8-barcelona/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/SSI-FrameworkProposal.md)
  * by Rieks Joosten
  * "The SSIF provides a thought model and corresponding terminology that allows us to think in a precise manner about SSI within the context of its purpose(s) - which for us is the generic enablement of electronic support for (administrative) business transactions."

  * by Elizabeth M. Renieris
  * "We are allowing the tides of technology and commerce to haphazardly turn everything into commodifiable data. But will we allow ourselves to be reduced to data points and, worse yet, commodified? If we are not deliberate about designing the correct legal frameworks for humanity in the data-driven age, we risk losing sight of our fundamental rights as humans."

### Misc.
* [PSDAD - Data Format with Secure Semantics](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot8-barcelona/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/psdad.md)
  * by Sandro Hawke
  * "Existing data serialization formats like JSON, JSON-LD, XML, and even ASN.1 (with its various encoding rules) work well enough for conventional computing environments, but they fall short when high levels of both trust and decentralization are required. PSDAD (plaintext self-describing assertional data) is a proposed new approach which uses natural language strings simultaneously as identifiers, delimiters, and documentation, resulting in a surprisingly simple and robust system with distinct advantages over known approaches in certain environments."

  * by David Lamers
  * "The universal ledger agent (ULA) is a component that is implemented by the app and the verifier. The ULA makes it possible to retrieve credentials from issuers, independently which standards and blockchain they use. Also, a verifier can accept and verify credentials from multiple standards."

### UX and Use Cases
* [Digital Identity for the Homeless](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot8-barcelona/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/Digital-Identity-for-the-Homeless.md)
  * by Mike Varley and Matthew Wong
  * "The focus of this topic is how to apply existing decentralized digital ID solution to help individuals experiencing homelessness in the city (Toronto). E.g. how to reserve services such as overnight shelters with digital ID, keep track of certificate offered by free public organized re-training programs, and built credibility via repeat use the the same digital ID with varies services run by non-profit organizations in the city etc."

* [Designing an Educational Credentialing Ecosystem](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot8-barcelona/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/educational-credentialing-ecosystem.md)
  * by Kim Hamilton Duffy, J. Philipp Schmidt, and Joe Andrieu
  * "One goal of this exercise was to understand whether (1) certain emerging SSI standards -- including Verifiable Credentials (VCs), Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) -- and (2) blockchain anchoring are essential to the simplified digital verifiable credentialing system. If so, we wanted to trace them to specific requirements.
  An additional goal was defining a threat model, to understand which aspects could be handled by the system, and which must be addressed by other systems. ...
  Our concern is that an effective digital credentialing ecosystem would make fraud within an issuing organization more appealing, so our final goal of this paper is to raise awareness among the broader SSI community."

* [Assist underrepresented groups when entering the labour market through self sovereign identity](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot8-barcelona/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/diverse-teams.md)
  * by Karolin Siebert
  * "As a consequence of increasing migration we have workers educated by a wild mix of educational systems, this should not be limiting them from approaching and receiving positions that they actually would like to work in and would be suitable for. Official diplomas and certificates, proving previous studies and work experience, are not necessarily recognised, available in physical form or easily translatable in a certified manner. In addition to that and estimate of the World Bank states that 1 Billion of people are without a formal identity. Being assigned one would give them better access to the work market since just their physical presence and knowledge is not enough in many cases, but rather we require proof for education and experience."
  * #DID #VC


* [Where's the UX?](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot8-barcelona/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/did-ux.md)
  * by Alberto Elias
  * "I've been doing some user testing with both developers and non-technical folks and every single one of them has complained about the authentication and registration flows. We all agree that this work is for nothing if people don't end up using them. This community is definitely human-focused, but initial DID implementations haven't nailed the user experience yet."

  * by Venn Agency - Sam Chase, Joni McKervey, and Benji Miller
  * "This paper will explore how we may architect a more complete individual sovereignty via privacy and place identity as a person moves between private and public physical locations (home, transit, work etc). ​ By mapping our rights and reasonable expectations to privacy across different contexts and comparing with the rights of devices in our spaces, we’ll seek to outline systems of access and control that work in accordance with the rights and needs of both sides."

  * by Juan Caballero and Jefferson Sofarelli
  * "Our long-term proposal is to design an SSI-platform-agnostic DID widget or middle-ware system for CMSs such that at the time of committing a canonical version of a published piece on a given publication's CMS, that canonical version could be hashed and signed, with signature and hash being stored in an immutable, external record against which the signature could later be checked (i.e., making a verifiable claim of authorship linking the article's original published form to a DID controlled by its author)."

### Verifiable Claims (VC)
* [EU Digital Signature vs. VC Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ehi0WMEJWNZV5Cx4wXsqPQC-wRcF4Zi2/view)
  * by L. Boldrin
  * To some extent a pdf signed document (or xml, json...) can be used to make trustworthy information about me available to a verifier. People ask: Why do we need VCs? What is the additional value they bring? This note provides an initial hyoothesis which I would like you to challenge: VCs without ledger provide, as added value, subject confirmation and anonymity/pseudonimity support. VCs with ledger provide, as a further value, just VC revocation."

  * by Matt Stone and Dan Burnett
  * "In the world of Verifiable Credentials, it is essential that Verifiers can trust Issuers. To this end, there must be a common understanding of the 'functional identity' of the Issuer. How do humans establish the appropriate level understanding to trust the artifact with conviction? i.e. how does one link 'this key' to 'that real world entity (person, company, etc)'"

  * by Moses MA
  * "This is a proposal to facilitate the collaborative drafting of a technical paper that describes the principles and key design considerations for a use case for verifiable physical address claims. Individuals within the global postal network now seek to understand the “decentralization revolution” and help to develop game-changing, blockchain-powered new business models for the world."
