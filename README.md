# Rebooting the Web of Trust VIII: Barcelona (March 2019)

This repository contains documents related to RWOT8, the eighth
Rebooting the Web of Trust design workshop, which will run in
Barcelona, Spain on March 1st to 3rd, 2019. The goal of the workshop
was to generate five technical white papers and/or proposals on topics
decided by the group that would have the greatest impact on the
future.

##  Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants produced a one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on either:

* A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
* A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

**NOTE:** To add a paper, create a pull request to this repo with your contribution (preferably .md file or PDF), along with updates to the README.md in this folder and at the top of the repo with a link to your paper and your name. Please also include a byline with contact information in the paper itself.
